<b>What is the linked list?</b>
<br>
Linked List can be defined as a collection of objects called nodes that are randomly stored in the memory.<br>
A node contains two fields i.e. data stored at that particular address and the pointer which contains the address of the next node in the memory.<br>
The last node of the list contains a pointer to the null.<br><br>
<b>Uses of Linked List</b><br>
The list is not required to be contiguously present in the memory. The node can reside anywhere in the memory and linked together to make a list. This achieves optimized utilization of space.<br>
List size is limited to the memory size and doesn't need to be declared in advance.<br>
Empty nodes can not be present in the linked list.<br>
We can store values of primitive types or objects in the singly linked list.<br><br>
<b>What Are the Types of Linked Lists?</b><br>
There are four key types of linked lists:<br>
<b>Singly linked lists<br>
Doubly linked lists<br>
Circular linked lists<br>
Circular doubly linked lists</b><br><br>
<b>What is a Singly Linked List?</b><br>
 
A singly linked list is a unidirectional linked list. So, you can only traverse it in one direction, i.e., from head node to tail node.<br>
<br><b>Structure of Singly Linked List</b> <br>
There are many applications for singly linked lists. One common application is to store a list of items that need to be processed in order. For example, a singly linked list can be used to store a list of tasks that need to be completed, with the head node representing the first task to be completed and the tail node representing the last task to be completed.<br>
Singly linked lists are also often used in algorithms that need to process a list of items in reverse order. For example, the popular sorting algorithm quicksort uses a singly linked list to store the list of items that need to be sorted. By processing the list in reverse order, quicksort can sort the list more efficiently.
<br><br><b>What is a Doubly Linked List?</b><br>
A doubly linked list is a bi-directional linked list. So, you can traverse it in both directions. Unlike singly linked lists, its nodes contain one extra pointer called the previous pointer. This pointer points to the previous node.<br>
<br><b>Structure of Doubly Linked List </b><br>
A doubly linked list of singly linked lists is a data structure that consists of a set of singly linked lists (SLLs), each of which is doubly linked. It is used to store data in a way that allows for fast insertion and deletion of elements.<br>
Each SLL is made up of two parts: a head and a tail. The head of each SLL contains a pointer to the first element in the list, and the tail contains a pointer to the last element.<br>
It is advantageous over other data structures because it allows for quick insertion and deletion of elements. Additionally, it is easy to implement and can be used in a variety of applications.<br>
<br><b>What is a Circular Linked List?</b><br>
A circular Linked list is a unidirectional linked list. So, you can traverse it in only one direction. But this type of linked list has its last node pointing to the head node. So while traversing, you need to be careful and stop traversing when you revisit the head node.<br>
<br><b>Structure of Circular Linked List </b><br>
A circular linked list is a type of data structure that uses linked list technology to store data in a linear, sequential fashion. However, unlike a traditional linked list, a circular linked list has no beginning or end – it is essentially a ring of nodes. This makes circular linked lists ideal for applications where data needs to be processed in a continuous loop, such as in real-time applications or simulations.<br>
Circular linked lists are typically implemented using a singly linked list data structure. This means that each node in the list is connected to the next node via a pointer. The last node in the list is then connected back to the first node, creating the ring-like structure.<br>
Accessing data in a circular linked list is similar to accessing data in a traditional linked list. However, because there is no defined beginning or end to the list, it can be difficult to know where to start traversing the list. As a result, many implementations of circular linked lists use a "head" pointer that points to the first node in the list.<br>
Circular linked lists have a number of advantages over traditional linked lists. First, because there is no defined beginning or end to the list, data can be added and removed from the list at any time. This makes circular linked lists ideal for applications where data needs to be constantly added or removed, such as in a real-time application.<br>
Second, because data is stored in a ring-like structure, it can be accessed in a continuous loop. This makes circular linked lists ideal for applications where data needs to be processed in a continuous loop, such as in a real-time application or simulation.<br>
Third, because there is no defined beginning or end to the list, circular linked lists are typically more efficient than traditional linked lists when it comes to memory usage. This is because traditional linked lists often require additional memory for pointers that point to the beginning and end of the list. Circular linked lists, on the other hand, only require a single pointer to be stored in memory – the head pointer.<br>
Finally, circular linked lists are often easier to implement than traditional linked lists. This is because traditional linked lists often require the use of additional data structures, such as stacks and queues, to keep track of the list's beginning and end. Circular linked lists, on the other hand, only require a singly linked list data structure.<br>
<br><b>What is a Circular Doubly Linked List?</b><br>
A circular doubly linked list is a mixture of a doubly linked list and a circular linked list. Like the doubly linked list, it has an extra pointer called the previous pointer, and similar to the circular linked list, its last node points at the head node. This type of linked list is the bi-directional list. So, you can traverse it in both directions.<br>
<br><b>Structure of Doubly Circular Linked List</b><br> 
A doubly circular linked list (DCL) is a variation of the standard doubly linked list. In a DCL, the first and last nodes are linked together, forming a circle. This allows for quick and easy traversal of the entire list without the need for special case handling at the beginning or end of the list. DCLs are often used in applications where data needs to be processed in a sequential fashion, such as in a video or audio player. The circular nature of the list allows for quick and easy movement from one node to the next without the need for special case handling. DCLs are also sometimes used in applications where data needs to be accessed randomly, such as in a database. In this case, the circular nature of the list allows for quick and easy movement to any node in the list without the need for special case handling.
